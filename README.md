*** Need to create files on local disk as the saved data needs to be fetched when Inverted Index is not built and for calculating Cosine similarity for 
Relevance Feedback.

For Example :: 
1) "C:\\Users\\shaha\\Desktop\\fileData.txt"     - For storing HashMap which stores File title and File Data
2) "C:\\Users\\shaha\\Desktop\\hashMap.txt"      - For storing Inverted Index
3) "C:\\Users\\shaha\\Desktop\\titleHashMap.txt" - For Storing HashMap which stores document Id and Document Title

Change the file path as per your local disk.


Place sample documents which works as the data on which the search engine should work.


Run the web application on a server.
